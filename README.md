###  More details
Please refer to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01810.pdf).

### Operating environment
Our method runs on Windows 10 operating system. 
Please install Opencv3(https://opencv.org/opencv-3-0.html) and Visual Studio 2013.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JXingZhao/FLIC.git
```

The Datasets we use are BSDS500 Dataset(https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/) and PASCAL Context Dataset
(https://www.cs.stanford.edu/~roozbeh/pascal-context/)
