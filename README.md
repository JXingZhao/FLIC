## Deeply Supervised Salient Object Detection with Short Connections

### Network architecture and more details
Please refer to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01810.pdf).

### Operating environment
Our method runs on Windows 10 operating system. 
Please install Opencv3(https://opencv.org/opencv-3-0.html) and Visual Studio 2013.
```bash
cd <caffe_root>/examples
git clone https://github.com/JXingZhao/FLIC.git
```
```
You can also download it from [here (google drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B21WWgRw0U1uMFVKN3NPT0VHMW8/view?usp=sharing). The results produced by this model are slightly different from the ones we reported in our paper (with higher F-measure score and also higher MAE score).

If you want to train the model, please prepare your own training dataset first. The data layer we used here is similar to the one used in [HED](https://github.com/s9xie/hed). You can also refer to the data layer used in [Deeplab](https://bitbucket.org/aquariusjay/deeplab-public-ver2) or write your own one. 

You may also find our data layer [here](https://github.com/Andrew-Qibin/caffe_dss). Notice that if you use caffe, please cite their paper.

Then, run
```bash
python run_saliency.py
```

If you want to test the model, you can run
```bash
ipython notebook DSS-tutorial.ipynb
```  

About the CRF code we used, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Andrew-Qibin/dss_crf). Notice that please provide a link to the original code as a footnote or a citation if you plan to use it.

* [MSRA10K](http://mmcheng.net/msra10k/): You can also use this dataset for training as some works did.
* [Evaluation Code (Windows)](https://github.com/MingMingCheng/CmCode/tree/master/CmLib/Illustration): The cold is based on MS Visual Studio.
* [Evaluation Code (Ubuntu)](https://github.com/Andrew-Qibin/SalMetric): This code is based on C++ and with a python wrapper for python users.
